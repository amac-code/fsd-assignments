Problem 1: Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

Problem 2: Create a method that accepts a list of numbers and returns the largest number in the list.

Problem 3: Implement a function that reverses a given string and returns the reversed string.

Problem 4: Write a program that uses a list to store user names.
           Implement a method to add a new name to the list, and another method to check if a given name exists in the list.
           If the name exists, return "Name found," otherwise return "Name not found."

These problems cover the basics of methods, data passing, returning values, and working with different data types,
helping you practice and reinforce your understanding of these concepts.
