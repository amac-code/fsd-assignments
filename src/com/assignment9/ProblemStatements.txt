Problem 1: String Manipulation

Write a Java program that takes a user input string and then performs the following operations:

Print the length of the string.
Convert the string to uppercase and print it.
Check if the string contains the word "Java" (case-insensitive) and print "Contains 'Java'" or "Does not contain 'Java'" accordingly.



Problem 2: Array Sum and Average

Create an array of integers in Java. Calculate and print the sum of all the elements in the array.
Then, calculate and print the average of the elements.


Problem 3: Type Casting and Conditional Statements

Write a Java program that takes a user input number (a floating-point number) and does the following:
If the number is greater than or equal to 10, cast it to an integer and print "Integer part: [integer value]."
If the number is less than 10, cast it to an integer and print "Rounded to the nearest integer: [integer value]."


These problems will help you practice working with strings, arrays, type casting, conditional statements, and basic user input in Java.
